- bulid an Electric citect
- report in Virtual Environment. 
- IOT Element simulation.


Project

Bulid a simple project for Handling :

Ardouo simulation.
IOT Element simulation.

int led = 7; 

void setup()
{
  pinMode(led,OUTPUT );
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}

Secondly Project building Simple IOT system .

Idea :

opening the garage of the house through SBC programming is that if he presses the Push button, the garage door opens .

IOT elemnts used :

push button
SBC
Door
summary

The Internet of Things (IoT) connects all objects to the Internet.
Devices can communicate with each other and with the cloud.
This will lead to innovative applications.
